<h1>Welcome to Ruby-Go!</h1>

<p>This project is in active development stage. Main missing features are staggering:
<ul>
<li>No AI so you cannot play against the program. 
We have a huge ambition for this part, or at least are planning to have a hell of a fun trying to build it!
</li>
<li>No internet remote server ability. This can be another fun part to add. 
Note that if it works one day we would really like to see a game happen between 3 or 4 players, 
since this is an added feature that we were curious about.
</li>
<li>No real GUI yet. The simplistic GUI you can access by using the links below has the convenient advantage to 
allow us to test the program using a mouse instead of entering all the moves in console mode... This is why
it was coded.
</li>
<li>Mmm... Thinking a bit, we are also missing a score counting feature, and probably a bunch of other things
I cannot think of right now. Life is fun! :)
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Playing with Browser GUI</h1>

<h2>Start the server</h2>
<em>First</em>, please start your web server <em>before</em> clicking on the links below.<br>
For example, you can start it with a command like:<br>
<pre>
cd .../ruby-go/src
.../ruby.exe main_server.rb
</pre>

You should see a message like:
<pre>
I, [2013-08-15T20:49:24.000000 #1372]  INFO -- : Starting the server...
</pre>

<h2>Start a new game</h2>
<p>Once the server is running, you can try any of the links below:</p>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/newGame?size=5&players=2&ai=0&handicap=0">5x5, 2 human players (nice for tests!)</a><br>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/newGame?size=9&players=2&ai=1&handicap=5">9x9, 1 player against dumb AI, handicap of 5</a><br>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/newGame?size=9&players=2&ai=0&handicap=0">9x9, 2 players (to load a game and check score counting feature)</a><br>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/newGame?size=19&players=2&ai=0&handicap=0">Regular 19x19 board, 2 human players</a><br>


<h1>Playing in console window</h1>
<p>We use this more for testing and debugging. For this purpose this is much easier than the browser interface.<br>
Everything is in text mode and will give you the good old DOS feeling again...
</p>

<pre>
cd .../ruby-go/src
.../ruby.exe main_console.rb
</pre>

<p>The settings are in the script "main_console.rb" itself. For example the number of players, AI, etc.<br>
Remember to change the logging level in logging.rb if you want to see a matrix-movie-like torrent of 
information about what happens in the background.<br>
Type "help" for a list of the available commands.
</p>

<h1>Run the tests</h1>
<p>Until an autobuild is set, these should be run manually as often as needed 
(especially before checking in code changes).
</p>

For the unit tests:
<pre>
cd .../ruby-go/src/test
.../ruby.exe test_all.rb
</pre>

For the performance (speed) test:
<pre>
cd .../ruby-go/src/test
.../ruby.exe test_speed.rb
</pre>
